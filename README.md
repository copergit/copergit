Hello! I'm Matteo Mosangini, a passionate Physics teacher with a diverse range of interests that span across photography, electronics, computer science, and astronomy. I believe in the power of integrating technology and hands-on learning to make science both engaging and accessible.
My Interests
ðŸ“· Photography

Photography is a perfect blend of art and science. I enjoy capturing the beauty of the world through my lens, and often use photography to illustrate key physics concepts like light refraction, reflection, and the principles of optics. 
ðŸ”Œ Electronics

I love bringing theory to life through practical electronics projects. From building simple circuits to creating more complex devices, I strive to make learning interactive and fun. 
ðŸ’» Computer Science

Computational physics is a field I'm deeply invested in. I teach students how to use programming languages like Python, Java and Julia to model physical phenomena, analyze data, and create simulations.
ðŸŒ  Astronomy

The universe is a constant source of wonder and inspiration. I enjoy sharing my passion for astronomy with my students through stargazing sessions, telescope workshops, and discussions on the latest astronomical discoveries. 

I'm always excited to connect with fellow educators, students, and enthusiasts. Feel free to reach out to me via Email. Let's collaborate and inspire the next generation of scientists together!
